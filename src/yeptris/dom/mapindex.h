/* mapindex.h — lazy per-mapping key index (TODO.impl/11).
 *
 * O(1) map lookup over the sibling-linked pair list: on a mapping's
 * first lookup an open-addressing table (view hash -> key child id)
 * is built from its pairs; probes compare the full view bytes on
 * hash matches. First key wins on duplicates (the linear scan's
 * contract). Only SCALAR keys are indexed — collection keys never
 * match a string lookup, exactly like the scan.
 *
 * Tables and the per-node slot array live on the system allocator
 * (NOT the DOM pool): mutation invalidates a table by freeing it,
 * and pool memory cannot be individually released. Everything is
 * freed at document destruction.
 *
 * Threads: table builds and mutations serialize on the document's
 * index mutex; built tables are immutable, so concurrent probes are
 * safe — the read-only sharing contract holds.
